        nice memory analysis utility in python. as everyone has python thanks to portage,
        that istn't a problem, but having a scipt bundle will be better when genalyze is in portage
    awk '/run/ && /script/ { print }' irclogs/#gentoo.log
        log the #gentoo chan and look for cases of people using this script

    when asking fro optional modules, after just pressing enter, deafualts to Y (or don't wait for enter, but I don't like that)
        but not waiting for enter could be for the ending sequence
    ask "are there any comment lines that are special? " if no, grep them out
    print echo $VAR literaly  without variable substitution in module desc
    first echo $DESKTOP_SESSION, than ask for wM if nothing conatined in that var
    implement -nr ... dump to less (read only non interacive)
    change -n to -nu (upload only non interactive)
    print out "processing" to hide lag...or see /-\-/ spin
    fisrt say "these are optional" than ask for each of opt modules
        The following questions are all OPTIONAL! Answer (Y)es if you would like to supply this information ?
        Each question is DEFAULTED to Y so you may just tap <ENTER> to continue or N if you prefer not to include 
        this info.

        << Exported shell variables >>		Y/N	_
        << Disk Usage & Statistics >> 		Y/N	_		(this is missing in the newest version)
        << Exported shell variables >>		Y/N	_
        << Network status >>			Y/N	_
        << Routing Tables >>			Y/N	_
        << DNS Servers >>			Y/N	_
    add modules: opt=(groups) analyze=(CHOST 
        oh yeah! another 'in the middle of the night though'....  cat /proc/cpuinfo & cat /proc/meminfo & free -m
        <Griz64> we're going to be looking at the CHOST= line and it's tough to know if it's right, if we do NOT know what proc is really in the box.
        <Griz64> groups would be handy as well
